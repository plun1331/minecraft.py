# minecraft.py

A simple Minecraft client wrapper for Python 3.10+.

**This project is currently in a very very very very very very early stage.** Don't expect it to do anything yet.

## Installing

The library currently cannot be installed, as it is not a valid project.

You can, however, `git clone` it and use it as a module.
